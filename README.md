The International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) maintain dictionaries of datanames for use in
crystallographic datafiles. These dictionaries are written in Dictionary Definition Languages (DDLs), 
with the most modern DDL being DDLm. DDLm dataname definitions may additionally contain algorithms
describing how the defined dataname can be calculated from other items in the dictionary.

This software is a browser-based interface to the DDLm/dREL system.
